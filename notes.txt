1. At bronze ingest, add ingestion summary at the end.
2. Ingestion watermark
3. In terminal, add time it took to ingest in minutes + seconds, file size (if low operational cost to get)
    and the shape of the csv file. Also add path where it is written to.
4. Validate ingestion (row count, filesize)
5. Append to tables with the same filenames.
6. view data ib a database



3 January:
- Check decimal values in pace columns


- This hour of day query shows play basically the hole day! We have to double check datetime standardisation:
SELECT 
    hour(fix_timestamp) as hour_of_day, 
    count(*) as fixes,
    count(DISTINCT round_id) as rounds
FROM fact_telemetry_event
WHERE fix_timestamp IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

- We need to validate that we ingested the data correctly...somehow

- Determine where the bottlenecks happen in a course
- Map geospatial data
- Measure processing power and storage needed for AWS clusters
